# Introduction
The project is a serious vision to combine different aspects of cross-platform development (Currently: C++, Qt, CMake, GTest, and more) all together in best practice. The foreseen outcome was a perfect platform to be used as libraries provided for other similar softwares. The exact documentation and clean-code programming was a constant matter in mind.
